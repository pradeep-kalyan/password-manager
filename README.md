# A password manager that securely stores passwords locally on the device using AES-256 bit encryption and advanced hashing techniques. This ensures the safe and secure use of passwords. The password generator helps create strong passwords, which can be copied immediately for use anywhere. The search function allows users to input a website name and retrieve the corresponding password, which can then be copied for login purposes. Upon logging out of the application, the file is encoded to prevent unauthorized access, making it hacker-proof.#
